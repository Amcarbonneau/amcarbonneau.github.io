                    Vermont Lakes That Have Experienced an Algal Bloom
                </a>
                <p>
                    This interactive map was re-designed after production assignment #2. My first production for this assignment was very confusing to look at and had low interactivity (seen on the left). 
                    Pop-ups for this map were not polished and didn't look neat, symbology was confusing because I was trying to portray different years with different colors. This wasn't very helpful 
                    since a lot of lakes had blooms multiple years in a row but this map looks like each lake only experienced 1 bloom per year. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I decided to re-make this map using JavaScript and Google Maps for better interactivity. I made it so that every lake has a pin, with pin colors including: <br> green = lake had bloomed 1 year <br>
                    yellow = lake had bloomed 2 years <br> orange = lake had bloomed 3 years <br> red = lake bloomed all 4 years <br> This way, the coloring is a lot less confusing. 
                    I also made the descriptions neater, now when you click it gives the name of the lake, the years that it bloomed, and a website for the lake if it was available. 
                </p>

                </a>
                <p>
                    The main problem I dealt with during this production is that buildings are very small when looking at them from a state level. To increase the contrast between these tiny 
                    buildings and the state, I used the bloom, saturate, and brightness and contrast effects. This allowed me to make them VERY neon, and the bloom made them look a little bit bigger 
                    and increased their size on the map. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To make it interactive, you can zoom in and out, and also click on each building to see details about the filming location.
                    I also published this as a story map, which has a feature called ‘map tour’ that allows me to add pins for buildings, descriptions, and pictures.
                    This makes it more interactive because scrolling through the pictures automatically updates the map and highlights the corresponding pin. It also works in reverse, so clicking a pin 
                    automatically finds the related picture.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After receiving evaluations from the TA, I was able to clean up the attribute table in the map and fix any spelling errors that were causing extra genres to appear.

                    Hiking Survey
                </a>
                <p>
                    For this production I decided to make a survey that could track the most popular hiking spots. The goal was to understand what major demographics were hiking in certain areas and when. 
					The survey asks where the people hiked, who they were accompanied by, what time it was, and what level of schooling they were in i.e highschool, college, done/not in college. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These surveys are then added to my feature layer in ArcGIS (picture below), where I can see where observations might start clustering. Because this was done at the end of the semester I made
					a few mock survey answers so that there were some observations to see on the map. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Again, the main goal is to be able to visualize if there are any hiking hotspots in the area. 
                </p>
